# DataQuest Project 20: Titanic Survival Classification

This is the 20th project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project four different machine learning models were created to make predictions on the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The resulting best models were then used to make a submission to the Kaggle competition on this dataset.

The educational goal of the project was to find the best parameters for each different machine learning algorithm and then take part in a Kaggle competition using an automated process to create each different submission.

## Prerequisites

This project requires only the Jupyter notebook containing the completed project.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`, `tensorflow` and `Pandas`, ` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
